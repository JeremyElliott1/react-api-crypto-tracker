# React Crypto Coin Tracker

Crypto Coin Tracker that consumes the coingecko API (https://www.coingecko.com/en/api), and dynmaically renders details for 50 crypto currencies.
The user can search for a specific crypto currency. Using React's useEffect hook, the coins that are displayed dynamically re-render based on whether a coins name partly matches user input.
